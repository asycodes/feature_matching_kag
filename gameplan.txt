## ideas to try out

1) Symmetry Matching is one image matching another matches, we do it the other way round
and see if it matches too

2) try out Image retrieval 

3) try on computer instead


4) issue of false matching
- matches the object but not the environment around it. try
with multi different feature extraction. eg indoor vs outdoor
- but the environment can also be part of the extension of the 
other object.

- looking at the stairs door example, one of the image has a door with metallic rails,
the other has wooden rails with strings. both have staircases.
one of the images has majority stairs (65%), we want to have feature points
that are balanced as w

- altered images include, white boxes to block info, rotation, blurred faces

- btw pls do a global feature extraction as the test folder has multiple datasets but different scenes
( this is so we can remove outliers faster. and reduce image matching efforts etc)


idea
algorithmically find matches based on how humans do it. do dbscan on an image w densed
features. crop the densest portion and do feature matches with other images. afterwards, do
do feature match with the non-densest portion with the matched-images.
